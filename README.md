# House-Price-Prediction
# Overview
Predicting Sales Price of each House in Test Dataset using various Machine Learning Algorithms.  It is a Advanced Problem of Regression which requires advanced techniques of feature selection &amp; extraction, modelling, model evaluation, and Statistics.  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) &amp; Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to check the performance of these Algorithms.  Algorithms Compared: Linear Regression & Gradient Descent

# Description of Data
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this  dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in SQFT, FLOOR, BEDROOM, LIVING ROOM & BATHROOM this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Goal
It is our job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
